Dear elected official,

I voted you into office. That means I gave you a job to do. Which includes first and foremost, protecting my God given fundamental rights as a human being, also ensuring the same for my brothers and sisters. Followed by maintaining and improving (if possible) the economy we as a society partake in; for the same reason we (the voters) have granted you access to the taxpayers money. Please spend it wisely; didn't your father teach you, "Never spend more than you earn." follow such time tested and worthwhile advice. Moreover you have a responsibility endowed upon you to discourage violent, anti-social behavior. Enforce the law, advisably beginning in your own house. 'Cause haven't you heard, "It is better, proverbially, to rule your own spirit than to rule a city." Finally your job requires transparency, let the people see what you are doing, they will decide soon whether you are good at your job or not.

It's not an easy job, but if you are up for the challenge, you might lose friends and family. Some people we see you as, and call you evil incarnate for opinions you hold. You will be scrutinized by friends and foe alike, your actions will affect generations to come. Can you go the distance? Or rather would you when you know you ought to, but at the same time see many of your colleagues taking the "easier way"? Please ponder.

Thanking you

Yours sincerely

A concerned citizen.
