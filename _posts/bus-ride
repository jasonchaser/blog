Bus Ride
Some of what I’m going to say here is hyperbole but most of it is very real. Bus rides in India to be more specific in Kerala is a one of the kind experiences. At peak hours if you do manage to get in the bus then you are duty bound to stand up straight face- forward and stay standing holding that bar above your head like a still photograph. Breathing with ease is a luxury, most people can’t afford. If someone were to take a vertical cross-section of this rectangular steel box running on four wheels all the people inside would seem like neatly stacked files. Usually when in this position I have noticed that the tall ones have to do a 3-tiered job; one, make sure that that annoying bar over your head doesn’t hit you, two, during acceleration and brake hold on for dear life, and three, carry the weight of that smaller fella who is leaning on you. This is your solemn duty. 
Anyway, imagine yourself standing in a crowd at a bus stop, to get in the bus you have to very aware of your surroundings that is the level of traffic the number of students ready to board the same bus and you have to calculate the probability of where the bus will stop. The last one begins as soon as you have spotted the bus in the horizon. Let’s say you manage all three tasks well and the door of the bus is near you and the bus has stopped, to get in, you would need to have properties like that of Venom (the spiderman’s villain from the comic books) to slither in through the crowd. 
Now, let’s say you were not that successful but you are standing on the steps at the door, my advice just hang-on and enjoy the ride. Now I could go on about the bus conductors incredible walking-through-walls ability as he manages to get to the front and back of the bus right through the wall of flesh. Also, about the various groaning sounds the bus makes conveying its inconvenience of carrying your burden. And much more. The limited stop bus is a whole different story.
